# R Markdown Practice
# INFO-201 Winter
In this activity, you should follow the steps in the `analysis.R` file, then create a file called `index.Rmd` and do the following:
- In a code chunk, `source()` the `analysis.R` file
- Write a short paragraph where you state the number of COVID cases and deaths (calculated in your analysis)
- Display the chart that you created

Then, click the `knit` button to compile your file to a webpage. To view the page on the web, push your code up to GitHub, then visit:
